## 1. Introduction
This project serves as the introductory framework ... In the future, this project aims to bridge reinforced concrete design into the more complex workflow in a more complex systems in the future.

**This project tries to answer these questions:**
- How Co-design could be used to design reinforced concrete (RC) structures?
- Could Co-design be used to design RC structure feasibly?
- What are the trade-off in using Co-design to design RC structures compared to the traditional methods that are being used in the industry?

---
The datasets (including the model's implementations) were generated using Julia.
The Co-design problem is solved using the MCDP package provided in class through Python interface.
